# CustomDynamicLanguage
A Java application has been developed to support a dynamic language that users can interact with via the command line. 
Users can initialize their own variables and functions in real-time due to dynamic typing. 
We've crafted our own syntax using a custom parser. 
The program supports features such as while loops, if-else statements, function calls, and more.
